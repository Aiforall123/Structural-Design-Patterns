## Introduction

## Getting Started

p5.js offers mainly 2 ways to use the library. User can either use the p5.js web editor provided by the library's official website or locally set p5.js to work on their desktop. 


### Using p5.js web editor 

Click [here](https://editor.p5js.org/) to access the web editor.
Below code should appear in the default editor. 

```javascript 
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
}
```

After making changes in the editor, click the pink play button to see your changes in the preview section. 


### Setting up p5.js editor locally 

We will use Visual Studio Code as our code editor as it is one of the most used and easy to set up. 
Download visual studio code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download the live server extension [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server) by following the instructions under the "VS Code Live Server" section. 

There are different ways to use p5.js on a user's local computer. 

#### Download a complete p5.js library 

[Download p5.js](https://p5js.org/download/) After clicking this page, scroll down and download "p5.js complete" project under Complete Library.  

Open the downloaded folder using Visual Studio Code. Under the folder named "empty-example", head to `index.html` and start the live server by clicking the "Go Live" button in the status bar or by `ALT-L` `ALT-O`. You will edit the `sketch.js` file and those changes will be reflected in the local browser. 


#### Using hosted p5.js library

Instead of downloading the whole package, there is another option of using the p5.js file hosted online as all versions of p5.js are stored in a CDN. Create a folder and inside create `index.html` and `sketch.js`. In `index.html` place the below code and start the live server by clicking the "Go Live" button in the status bar or by `ALT-L` `ALT-O`. 
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.9.1/lib/p5.js"></script>
    <script src="sketch.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

### First Sketch 

After setting up p5.js, write this code below in `sketch.js` to check if p5.js is working as intended. 

```javascript 
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);
  ellipse(50,50,80,80);
}
```
It should show a white ellipse with a black outline whose width and height are 80 pixels and located 50 pixels from the left and down from the top.
