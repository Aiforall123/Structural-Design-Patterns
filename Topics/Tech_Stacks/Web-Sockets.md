## Introduction
In the evolving landscape of web development, the need for real-time, interactive web applications is more prominent than ever. Users expect dynamic experiences with instant updatesâ€”be it in chat applications, live sports scores, or stock market feeds. WebSockets represent a significant advancement in web communication, allowing for real-time, full-duplex communication between the client and server. This technology is especially relevant to the CSC301 curriculum as it introduces students to modern web development practices, preparing them for the challenges of developing interactive, user-centric software solutions.

## Understanding WebSockets
WebSockets are a powerful protocol embedded within the familiar web technology stack, enabling a significant leap in communication capabilities over the Internet. They provide a way to overcome the limitations of the traditional HTTP request-response model, especially when it comes to real-time, low-latency communication.

Unlike HTTP, where a new connection is established for each request and response, WebSockets establish a single, persistent connection between the client and the server. This connection is initiated by the client sending a special type of HTTP request, asking the server to upgrade the connection to a WebSocket connection.

### How the WebSocket Connection is Established:

### WebSocket Communication:


## WebSockets vs HTTP
While HTTP is a foundational web technology, its request-response model can introduce latency and inefficiency, particularly in scenarios requiring real-time updates. WebSockets address these limitations by establishing a persistent, full-duplex communication channel, offering several advantages:

- **Reduced Latency:** WebSockets eliminate the need for repeated HTTP handshakes, significantly decreasing latency.
- **Real-time Data Flow:** 
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** 

## Advantages and Disadvantages
**Advantages:**
- **Real-time Communication:** Enables applications like live sports updates, chat apps, and online gaming to function seamlessly.
- **Lower Overhead:** Keeps the connection open, removing the need to reestablish and reauthenticate for each interaction.
- **Flexibility:** Supports a wide variety of data types, from text to binary.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Complexity in Handling Connections:** Requires careful management of connection lifecycles and error handling.
- **Compatibility and Support Issues:** Older browsers or networks with strict firewall rules may block WebSocket connections.
- **Security Considerations:** Open connections can be vulnerable to attacks, necessitating robust security mechanisms like TLS encryption.

## Setting Up



## Real-World Use Cases
WebSockets are not just a technical curiosity; they power some of the most interactive and dynamic applications on the web today. Here are a few examples where WebSockets are used to create engaging user experiences:

### Chat Applications

### Financial Tick Data

### Collaborative Editing

### Online Gaming

### Streaming Services
