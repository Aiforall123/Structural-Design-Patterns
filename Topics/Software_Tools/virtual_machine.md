# What are Virtual Machines?

A virtual machine, or VM, resembles a physical computer in terms of components such as CPU, memory, and storage. However, unlike traditional hardware, VMs exist as software-defined entities within physical servers, functioning through code rather than tangible hardware[^1].

Virtualization involves creating a virtual computer with allocated CPU, memory, and storage resources, drawn from a physical host computer or a remote server. A VM operates as a computer file or image, emulating the behavior of a real computer. It can run within a window as an independent computing environment, facilitating tasks such as running different operating systems. A VM operates in isolation from the host system, ensuring that the software within the VM does not interfere with the primary operating system of the host computer[^1].

For example, if you own a Windows computer, but are required to develop in a Linux environment, you can utilize a VM to operate as your Linux machine, without having to purchase one physically.
